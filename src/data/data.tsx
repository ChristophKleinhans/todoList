This information is collected over time and used for personalised ads, ad measurement, audience insights, and product development specific to our ads program. If this sounds good to you, select "I Agree!" below. Otherwise, you can get more information, customize your consent preferences, or decline consent by selecting "Learn More". Note that your preferences apply only to Tumblr. If you change your mind in the future you can update your preferences any time by visiting your Privacy Settings. One last thing, our partners may process some of your data based on legitimate interests instead of consent but you can object to that by choosing "Learn More" and then disabling the Legitimate Interests toggle under any listed Purpose or Partner'
